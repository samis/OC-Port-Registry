# OC-Port-Registry
A port registry web application for OpenComputers.

# Specification
The object of this application is to provide a central, easily accessible point of reference regarding use of ports by programs.

It will use a web interface for users to log in (so that it is known who registered a port, not just what for), create a Project (to give the registration behind a port meaning, as well as to group multiple registrations if required).
Users would then be able to register a port for usage, specifying the Project the registration refers to.
Users would be available to view the complete lists of both ports and projects with all the relevant data. 
The web interface will not be complex, but it will not hide data.
